      "test_report_summary": "Blood work shows normal hemoglobin (13.4 g/dL) but microcytic indices (Low MCV 75.0 fL, Low MCH 27.7 pg) and Eosinophilia (8%). Fasting Blood Glucose is normal at 90 mg/dl. Stool analysis shows presence of mucus and vegetable cells. Urine routine is within normal limits.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The blood results indicate microcytosis (small red blood cells), which in the presence of normal hemoglobin suggests early-stage iron deficiency or a thalassemic trait; further iron studies are required for confirmation. The elevated eosinophil count (8%) is indicative of eosinophilia, commonly associated with allergic conditions, asthma, or parasitic infections, though the stool sample was negative for parasites. The presence of mucus in the stool may suggest mild intestinal irritation or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Regarding the patient's diabetes context, the fasting glucose of 90 mg/dl indicates well-controlled blood sugar levels.",

Hb is slightly elevated, while fasting blood glucose is within the normal range. The differential count shows a normal distribution of white blood cells.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level is slightly elevated (13.4 g/dL), which could indicate polycythemia. However, given the patient's age and the normal range, it warrants monitoring. Fasting blood glucose is within the normal range (90 mg/dL), which is good for a patient with diabetes. The differential count appears normal. The urine analysis is unremarkable, with no significant abnormalities detected.",

This could indicate early signs of iron deficiency or other underlying conditions. The other blood cell counts and percentages are within normal limits. Fasting blood glucose of 90 mg/dL is within the normal range for a diabetic patient, suggesting good glycemic control. However, continued monitoring is crucial for a patient with diabetes.",

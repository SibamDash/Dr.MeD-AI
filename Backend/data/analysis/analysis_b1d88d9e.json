      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level (13.4 gm%) is slightly elevated, which could indicate early signs of iron deficiency or other underlying conditions. The other blood cell counts are within normal limits. Fasting Blood Glucose of 90 mg/dl is within the normal range (70-110 mg/dl) for a patient with diabetes, suggesting good glycemic control. However, given the patient's existing diagnosis of diabetes, continued monitoring of HbA1c and fasting glucose is crucial. The slightly elevated Hb warrants further investigation to rule out iron deficiency or other potential causes.",

The WBC, RBC, and TPC are also within normal limits. The differential count shows Neutrophils at 60%, Eosinophils at 8%, Basophils at 0%, and Lymphocytes at 32%. Fasting Blood Glucose is 90 mg/dl, which is within the normal range. Urinalysis shows pale yellow color, acidic reaction, and no abnormalities detected.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level is slightly elevated, which could be a normal variation or indicative of a physiological response. The other CBC parameters are within normal limits. Fasting blood glucose is within the normal range, suggesting good glycemic control. The urinalysis is unremarkable.",

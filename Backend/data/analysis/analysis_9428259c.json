      "test_report_summary": "The patient's Hb is slightly elevated (13.4 gm%), TWBC, TRBC, TPC, and PCV are within normal ranges. Differential count shows Neutrophils at 60% and Lymphocytes at 32%. Fasting Blood Glucose is 90 mg/dl, which is within the normal range. Urine routine shows pale yellow color, acidic reaction, and no abnormalities detected.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level is slightly elevated, which could indicate polycythemia. While the other blood cell counts are within normal limits, it warrants further investigation to determine the underlying cause. Fasting blood glucose is normal, suggesting good glycemic control. The urine analysis is unremarkable. Given the patient's age and existing diabetes, monitoring of Hb and further investigation into the elevated Hb level is recommended.",

Stool examination reveals brownish semi-solid stool with acidic reaction and present food particles.",

The epithelial cells are within normal limits. The stool examination suggests dietary factors may be contributing to the stool characteristics. Given the patient's history of diabetes, monitoring urine output and electrolyte balance is crucial. Further investigation into the cause of the stool changes may be warranted.",

Stool routine and microscopic examination shows brownish consistency, semi-solid appearance, acidic reaction, and adequate bacteria flora. Complete blood cell count shows Hb 13.4 gm%, TWBC 7800/Cumm, TRBC 24.63 Mill/Cumm, TPC 23.06 Lacs/Cumm, PCV 23.5%, MCV 75.0 f1, MCH 27.7 pg, MCHC 37.0%, Neutrophils 60%, Eosinophils 0.8%, Basophils 0.0%, Lymphocytes 32%, Monocytes 0.0%. Biochemistry result: Fasting Blood Glucose 90 mg/dl.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb, TWBC, TRBC, TPC, PCV, MCV, MCH, and MCHC values are within the normal ranges. The differential count shows a normal neutrophil population with a slight increase in lymphocytes. Fasting blood glucose is within the normal range. The urine analysis is unremarkable. Given the patient's age and history of diabetes, monitoring of blood glucose levels and HbA1c is recommended to assess glycemic control. Further investigation may be needed based on the clinical context.",

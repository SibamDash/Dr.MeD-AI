Key findings include microcytosis (low MCV 75.0 fL), hypochromia (low MCH 27.7 pg), mild eosinophilia (8%), and mucus in stool (+). Blood glucose is normal (90 mg/dl).",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The Fasting Blood Glucose of 90 mg/dl indicates excellent glycemic control. The CBC reveals low MCV and MCH values, which characterize microcytic hypochromic red blood cells; this is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia or thalassemia trait. The mild eosinophilia (8%) combined with the presence of mucus in the stool suggests a possible parasitic infestation or an allergic gastrointestinal response, despite the absence of visible ova or larvae in this single sample. The presence of vegetable cells in the stool may indicate slightly impaired digestion or rapid transit time.",

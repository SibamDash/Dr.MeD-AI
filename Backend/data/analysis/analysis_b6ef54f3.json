      "test_report_summary": "The report includes a urine routine and microscopic examination, showing a pale yellow urine with acidic reaction and no abnormalities detected. Stool routine and microscopic examination reveals brownish consistency, semi-solid appearance, acidic reaction, and adequate bacteria flora. Complete blood cell count shows Hb 13.4 gm%, TWBC 7800/Cumm, TRBC 24.63 Mill/Cumm, TPC 23.06 Lacs/Cumm, PCV 23.5%, MCV 75.0 f1, MCH 27.7 pg, MCHC 37.0%, and differential count with Neutrophils 60%, Eosinophils 08%, Basophils 00%, Lymphocytes 32%, and Monocytes 00%. Biochemistry result shows Fasting Blood Glucose 90 mg/dl.",
      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level (13.4 gm%) is within the normal range, indicating adequate red blood cell production. The complete blood cell count appears largely normal. The fasting blood glucose level of 90 mg/dl is also within the normal range (70-110 mg/dl), suggesting good glycemic control. However, given the patient's existing condition of diabetes, continued monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial. The urine analysis results are unremarkable, indicating no acute urinary tract infection or other significant abnormalities.",

      "clinical_interpretation": "The patient's Hb level is slightly elevated (13.4 g/dL), which could indicate early signs of iron deficiency or other underlying conditions. The other blood cell counts and percentages are within normal limits. Fasting blood glucose of 90 mg/dL is within the normal range for a diabetic patient, suggesting good glycemic control. However, given the patient's existing diabetes diagnosis, continued monitoring of HbA1c and fasting glucose is crucial.",
